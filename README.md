# What is  a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from left to right. Regular expressions are used to replace text within a string, validating forms, extracting a substring from a string based on a pattern match, and so much more. The term "regular expression" is a mouthful, so you will usually find the term abbreviated to "regex" or "regexp".

## Summary
Imagine you are writing an application and you want to set the rules for when a user chooses their username. We want to allow the username to contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens and sometimes special characters. We also want to limit the number of characters in the username so it is not too long and cumbersome. We can use the following regular expression to validate the username:

The Regular Expression above can eccept usernames like Jac-k1-o1 or jac-K101 or Jack_101.
